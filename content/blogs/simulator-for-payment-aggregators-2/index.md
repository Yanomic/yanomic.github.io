## Typical Use Cases for Payment Aggregator Simulators

Below are user stories that demonstrate how payment aggregator simulators can be applied in real-world scenarios:

- **As a developer,** I need to verify payment flows and integration logic without depending on real payment gateways or incurring transaction costs, so I can develop and debug efficiently.
- **As a QA engineer,** I want to execute automated regression tests in CI/CD pipelines, so I can ensure that new changes do not break existing payment features.
- **As a tester,** I need to simulate rare or complex scenarios—like network timeouts, declined transactions, or processor errors—so I can confirm our system handles failures robustly.
- **As a performance engineer,** I want to generate high transaction volumes, so I can assess system performance and scalability without affecting real payment systems.
- **As a trainer or product manager,** I want to safely demonstrate payment flows or onboard new team members, so that no real transactions are triggered during training or demos.
- **As a compliance or security officer,** I need to validate how our systems handle sensitive data and compliance requirements using mock data, so we minimize the risk of exposing real customer information.



## Test Cases

Test cases define the specific scenarios that the payment aggregator expects the simulator to replicate. These scenarios help ensure that integrations are robust and can handle a wide range of real-world situations, from standard payment flows to edge cases and failures.

### How to Submit Test Cases
Payment aggregators can submit test cases to the simulator in several ways:
- **Inline with transaction requests:** Include the test scenario details directly within the transaction request payload, allowing dynamic, on-the-fly scenario specification.
- **Reference predefined cases:** Define test cases in advance (via configuration files, web UI, or API) and refer to them by ID or name in the transaction request.
- **Dynamic scenario parameters:** Pass scenario parameters (such as error codes, response delays, or status) as part of the transaction request to control simulator behavior for that specific call.
- **Hybrid approach:** Combine predefined cases with inline overrides, allowing a base scenario to be referenced and certain parameters to be customized per request.

By supporting these flexible submission methods, the simulator enables both ad-hoc and structured testing, making it easy for payment aggregators to cover a wide range of scenarios and workflows.


## Questions
* How to let the simulator know which scenario are we testing


* How do we store the test scenarios

* Why don't we use amount field for use scenarios
This would limit tests for settlement process
