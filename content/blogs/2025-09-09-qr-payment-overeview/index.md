## What are QR Code and QR-Based Payments?

### QR Code Fundamentals

**QR (Quick Response) codes** are two-dimensional barcodes that can store large amounts of data in a compact, machine-readable format. Originally developed by Denso Wave in 1994 for tracking automotive parts, QR codes have evolved into a versatile technology for various applications, with payments being one of the most transformative use cases.

#### Technical Specifications
- **Data Capacity**: QR codes can encode up to 7,089 numeric characters or 4,296 alphanumeric characters.
- **Error Correction**: Four error correction levels are available—L (~7%), M (~15%), Q (~25%), and H (~30%)—to ensure data recovery even if the code is partially damaged.
- **Readability**: QR codes are designed for omnidirectional (360-degree) readability.
- **Size Flexibility**: Standard QR codes range from 21x21 modules (Version 1) to 177x177 modules (Version 40), as specified in ISO/IEC 18004.
- **Scanning Distance**: Typical scanning distance is 10–50 cm, depending on the code size and scanning device.

### QR-Based Payment Systems

QR-based payments represent a revolutionary approach to digital transactions where payment information is encoded into a QR code and processed through mobile devices. This method eliminates the need for physical payment cards, cash, or complex payment terminals.


## Key Features

### Efficient

QR-based payment systems eliminate the need for fragile page redirects and cumbersome manual data entry, streamlining the entire checkout process. By allowing customers/merchants to simply scan a QR code, these systems significantly reduce the risk of input errors and accelerate transaction completion, resulting in a faster and more reliable payment experience for both merchants and consumers.

### Flexibility

QR payments provide exceptional versatility, supporting a wide range of business models (including in-store and e-commerce), platforms (desktop and mobile), devices (such as desktops, POS terminals, Apple, Android, Windows, and more), and use cases (merchant-presented, shopper-presented, dynamic, and static QR codes). This broad compatibility enables both merchants and customers to use their preferred devices, minimizing the need for specialized hardware and enhancing overall accessibility.

### Fast Setup

QR payment systems can be set up rapidly with minimal infrastructure, as they work with existing smartphones and tablets, often require only simple printed codes, and leverage cloud-based processing rather than on-premise hardware. This scalable approach makes QR payments suitable for businesses of any size.

### Security

QR payment systems utilize multiple advanced security measures to protect user data. Payment information is encrypted with industry-standard protocols, ensuring it remains confidential during both transmission and storage. Tokenization replaces sensitive details with secure tokens, reducing the risk of data leaks. Digital signatures are implemented to authenticate each QR code, safeguarding against tampering and fraudulent activity. Furthermore, QR codes are typically set to expire within 5 to 15 minutes, limiting the window for potential misuse. The effectiveness of these security practices has been proven at scale in markets like China (Alipay, WeChat Pay) and India (UPI).

## Bank-Based QR Payments

Bank-based QR payments refer to payment systems where traditional banks play a central role in facilitating QR code transactions. In these systems, banks either issue their own QR codes or participate in interoperable QR payment networks, allowing customers to make payments directly from their bank accounts using mobile banking apps or digital wallets linked to their accounts.

### How Bank-Based QR Payments Work

1. **QR Code Generation**: Merchants generate a QR code—either static (fixed for all transactions) or dynamic (unique for each transaction)—that encodes payment information such as the merchant’s bank account details, transaction amount, and reference numbers.
2. **Customer Scans the QR Code**: The customer uses their bank’s mobile app or a supported payment app to scan the QR code at the point of sale or online.
3. **Payment Authorization**: The app decodes the QR code and prompts the customer to confirm the payment. The transaction is then authorized using secure authentication methods, such as biometrics or PIN.
4. **Funds Transfer**: Upon authorization, the bank initiates a direct transfer of funds from the customer’s account to the merchant’s account, often in real time.
5. **Confirmation**: Both the customer and merchant receive instant confirmation of the transaction.

### Bank-Based QR Payments in Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia has emerged as a global leader in the adoption and innovation of bank-based QR payment systems. Driven by a combination of government initiatives, rapid digitalization, and a diverse financial landscape, countries in this region have implemented robust frameworks that enable seamless, interoperable QR payments across banks and payment providers.

The widespread adoption of bank-based QR payments in Southeast Asia has transformed the region’s payment landscape. Merchants benefit from lower transaction fees and instant settlement, while consumers enjoy convenience, security, and a unified payment experience. As digital economies continue to grow, further integration and cross-border interoperability are expected, positioning Southeast Asia at the forefront of cashless innovation.
