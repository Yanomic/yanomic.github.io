### Interoperability

Many countries have established national QR payment standards (e.g., India’s Bharat QR, Singapore’s SGQR, Thailand’s PromptPay), enabling customers of different banks to pay any participating merchant using a single QR code. Increasingly, cross-border initiatives are also being implemented—such as the linkage between Thailand’s PromptPay and Singapore’s PayNow—allowing users to make QR payments seamlessly across countries using their home bank apps.
