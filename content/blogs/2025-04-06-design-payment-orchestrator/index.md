Designing a payment orchestrator means creating a system that intelligently routes, manages, and abstracts payment flows across multiple PSPs (Payment Service Providers), gateways, and alternative payment methods. It acts as a middle layer to provide flexibility, reliability, and optimization for merchants. Its key responsibilities include:

* Routing transactions to the best-suited payment provider.
* Retrying failed transactions with fallback providers.
* Normalizing responses from different providers.
* Handling fraud & compliance checks (3DS, SCA, PSD2).
* Optimizing costs & performance (least-cost routing, latency-based routing).
* Supporting reconciliation & reporting.

## Key Considerations

### Architecture
* Modular & Extensible (plugins for new providers, fraud engines).
* Event-driven design (Kafka, RabbitMQ for async flows).
* Stateless services (for horizontal scaling).
* Caching layer (for routing rules, merchant configs).

### Data Model
* Unified transaction schema (normalized across providers).
* Idempotency keys (avoid duplicate processing).
* Audit logs (for debugging & compliance).

### Security
* PCI-DSS compliance (tokenization, vaulting).
* Encryption in transit & at rest (TLS, AES-256).
* Role-based access control (RBAC) (for admin dashboards).
* Support for velocity checks, IP/device fingerprinting, and risk scoring.

### Performance & Reliability
* Low-latency routing (cached rules, geo-distributed deployments).
* Graceful degradation (handle provider outages).
* SLA monitoring (track uptime, response times).

### **Business Logic**
* Smart retries (avoid retrying hopeless failures).
* Surcharge & dynamic pricing (pass fees to customers).
* Merchant-specific routing rules (custom logic per business).
* A pluggable rule engine to define custom routing logic, based on region, BIN, card type, currency, issuer bank, or past performance. 

## User Stories

### Multi-Provider Routing
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** transactions to be routed to the cheapest/fastest payment provider, **so that** I can reduce costs and improve checkout success rates.
* As a **Payment Operations Manager**, **I want** automatic fallback to a secondary provider if the primary one fails, **so that** we minimize declined transactions.
* As a **Data Analyst**, **I want** A/B testing capabilities for payment providers, **so that** we can compare performance and optimize routing rules.

### Payment Method Abstraction
* As a **Product Manager**, **I want** to support multiple payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL, etc.) through a common interface, **so that** users have flexible checkout options.
* As a **Developer**, **I want** to abstract payment operations (`authorize`, `capture`, `refund`, etc.) across methods, **so that** I can build once and reuse everywhere.

### Unified API
* As a **Developer**, **I want** to integrate once with a single, consistent API, **so that** I don't have to manage different PSP integrations myself.
* As a **Developer**, **I want** the orchestrator to normalize PSP responses, **so that** I can handle success and failure cases the same way regardless of the provider.

### Transaction Processing
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** the orchestrator to retry soft-declined payments with a different provider, **so that** I can recover lost sales.
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** to avoid retrying hard-declined transactions, **so that** I don’t annoy customers or increase fraud risk.
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** idempotent payment requests, **so that** accidental retries don’t result in duplicate charges.
* As a **System Admin**, **I want** webhook support for asynchronous payment status updates, **so that** I can keep my systems in sync without the need for constant polling.
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** all providers to trigger consistent events, **so that** I don’t have to manage provider-specific logic.
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** to initiate refunds or track disputes through a single system, **so that** I can resolve customer issues quickly.
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** to see dispute history and status across all PSPs, **so that** I can manage chargebacks effectively.

### Reconciliation & Reporting
* As a **Finance Team Member**, **I want** automated reconciliation between transactions and settlements, **so that** that accounting discrepancies are flagged early.

### Tokenization & Vaulting
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** to securely store customer payment methods for future use, **so that** I can support one-click and recurring payments.
* As a **Developer**, **I want** to choose between orchestrator-managed vault or PSP vaults, **so that** I can comply with PCI and optimize performance.

### Compliance & Security
* As a **Security Officer**, **I want** the orchestrator to be PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant, **so that** I can reduce audit scope and maintain trust.
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** support for 3DS and local authentication, **so that** I meet regulatory requirements and reduce fraud.
* As a **Compliance Officer**, **I want** automatic 3DS2/SCA handling for PSD2 compliance, **so that** we avoid regulatory penalties.
* As a **Risk Manager**, **I want** integration with fraud detection tools, **so that** we can block high-risk transactions.

### Visibility & Monitoring
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** to see real-time status and performance of each PSP, **so that** I can make informed decisions or take manual actions if needed.
* As a **System Admin**, **I want** to auto-disable unhealthy providers, **so that** routing avoids failing paths without human intervention.
* As a **Architect**, **I want** the system to have build-in metrics, **so that** we gain full visibility on how the system performs.
* As a **Merchant**, **I want** access to dashboards showing success rates, decline reasons, and provider performance, **so that** I can optimize my routing and checkout strategy.

### Scalability & Resilience
* As a **DevOps Engineer**, **I want** circuit breakers for failing payment providers, **so that** our system doesn’t get overwhelmed by retries.
* As a **Developer**, **I want** queue-based processing for high-volume periods, **so that** payments are processed reliably during spikes.
