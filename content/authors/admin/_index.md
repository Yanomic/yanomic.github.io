As an engineer, I bring a profound understanding of the payment ecosystem, with expertise in addressing pain points in transaction flows and enabling seamless solutions across countries and regions. My passion lies in designing and optimizing systems that enhance user experiences and drive efficiency.

As a tech enthusiast, I am deeply interested in backend architecture and related technologies, including messaging systems, microservices, databases, caching solutions, and containerization. I prioritize practical, reliable solutions that solve real-world problems over chasing cutting-edge technologies for their novelty.

As a lead, I have extensive experience managing diverse teams across cultures and time zones. I excel in balancing team priorities, collaborating with cross-functional groups, and fulfilling my own commitments. My adaptable leadership style enables me to align with team dynamics and deliver impactful results.
