#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

As an engineer, I bring a profound understanding of the payment ecosystem, with expertise in addressing pain points in transaction flows and enabling seamless solutions across countries and regions. My passion lies in designing and optimizing systems that enhance user experiences and drive efficiency.

As a tech enthusiast, I am deeply interested in backend architecture and related technologies, including messaging systems, microservices, databases, caching solutions, and containerization. I prioritize practical, reliable solutions that solve real-world problems over chasing cutting-edge technologies for their novelty.

As a lead, I have extensive experience managing diverse teams across cultures and time zones. I excel in balancing team priorities, collaborating with cross-functional groups, and fulfilling my own commitments. My adaptable leadership style enables me to align with team dynamics and deliver impactful results.
